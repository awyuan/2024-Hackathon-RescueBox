It's a hackathon, no time..

But here is the command we ran at the end to generate the outputs:
```
python3 tool-suite/text_scraper/text_scraper.py tool-suite/text_scraper/examples/inputs tool-suite/text_scraper/examples/word_detection_output --conf 0.7 --lang es
```

I use 'es' because that triggers latin model. If you have a specific language in mind, you can use that instead. Latin is just the most general.

You can see the specifics once you install easyocr at line 97 for specific language pairs. 
Also, installing polyglot requires guess and check, I installed a lot of new libraries based on errors and stackoverflow.

requirements.txt has the virtual env pip freeze output.

Sorry, no time, hope this helps anyway...
